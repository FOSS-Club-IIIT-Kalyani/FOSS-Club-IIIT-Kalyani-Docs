# Core Team Structure
The establishment of the core team should be done as soon as the lead's tenure begins, we adhered to the following proposed structure:

There will be two main teams: the **Core Team** and the **Memberâ€™s Team** . Both the teams will consist of individuals with expertise in one/multiple of the following domains:

- Managerial Backbone
- Tech Folks
- Creative Ones
- Word Spreader
- I know everything

For each event, a unique combination of these core team members will be assembled into an **Atomic Team** and tasked with organizing the specific event. This approach ensures that multiple Atomic Teams can **concurrently manage preparations** for various events.

# Core Team Recruitment Process
- Initially, we disseminated a formal application form, wherein participants were required to provide their personal details, specify their areas of expertise, respond to three questions, and submit evidence of their work within the specified domains. The form link is provided here: [link].
- Subsequently, shortlisted candidates received email notifications containing the option to choose a preferred time slot for an interview.
- During the interview process, emphasis was placed on evaluating candidates' previous experiences in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), assessing their comprehension and vision within the domain, and gauging their commitment to contributing to the community.

# Volunteering
For each event, depending upon the necessity, a volunteer form will be released so that people outside of the core team can also contribute and maybe in future be a part of the community.
This will allow people to contribute to the events they like, relate to and are available for. It also keeps up with the open spirit of the club and its ideology.
